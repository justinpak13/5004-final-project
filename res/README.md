# About/Overview
- This program allows for 2 players to play a game of Tic-Tac-Toe using a graphical user interface implemented using the Java swing library.
# List of Features
- This game implements all of the rules for Tic-Tac-Toe, including error handling which prevents users from inputting invalid moves during and after gameplay
# How to Run
- The game can be ran on the command line using the following command

`java -jar TicTacToe.jar`
# How to Use the Program
- After starting the program using the command line, a graphical user interface should open. As per custom, player X will go first. Using the mouse, the first player can select an area on the screen related to one of the nine areas. The corresponding mark should be placed in that area. The next player can then play their move in any of the open areas after. This repeats until there are no more open areas or if there is a winner
# Design/Model Changes
- No changes or updates
# Assumptions
- I assume that the players know how to play Tic-Tac-Toe and will attempt to play appropriately.
# Limitations
- Currently the program only implements one game and there is no way to escape the current game except by exiting the program. In future iterations, I would like to implement a menu that appears after each game that prompts the user if they would like to continue playing or exit. 
- Also, the game is only set to have two players. I would also like to implement an option for a computer player using the Min-Max algorithm so that a player could play alone.
